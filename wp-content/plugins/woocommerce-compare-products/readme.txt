Add a World Class Compare Products Feature to your WooCommerce store today with the WooCommerce Compare Products plugin.

== DESCRIPTION ==

The Compare Products extension for WooCommerce gives a product comparison feature that you'd only expect to find on the big corporate e-commerce sites.

WooCommerce Compare Products allows users to firstly add products to a compare widget basket, then at the click of a mouse the chosen products can be viewed in a state-of-the-art comparison table.

Chosen products are compared side-by-side, feature by feature, price-by-price. Discard products from the table at the click of a mouse as you hone in on the product that is the one for you. Save the comparison as a PDF or print it.
